# Vue Debugging Exercise

A simple Ruby on Rails application running on Vue.JS. The purpose of this application is to familiarize debugging Vue.JS components with tools such as the Vue.JS DevTools Extension for Google Chrome.

This application is to be used for pedagogical reasons, and has known errors with Vue.JS (hence the need for debugging).
